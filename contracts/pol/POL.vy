    Contract to manage the protocol owned liquidity.
    Actual operations are implemented in individual modules, this contract only serves to 
    manage its permissions. Modules can be approved to mint or burn yETH, receive ETH and receive tokens.
    yETH can only be minted up to the debt ceiling, which is determined by the amount of ETH deposited
